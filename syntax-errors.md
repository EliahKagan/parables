# Why one should always seek to understand syntax errors.

A sous chef, who has recently started cooking intricate dishes of perch, cooks something that does not seem quite perfect, and walked up to the head chef to ask for advice.

&ldquo;Please stop stepping on my foot,&rdquo; the head chef says.

Much of what the head chef says is abstruse or even incomprehensible, so the sous chef does not bother to seek to understand this obscure wisdom, no matter how many times the head chef repeats it, and pursues other approaches to examining the perch in question. Sometimes the sous chef simply throws out the perch, upon hearing, &ldquo;Please stop stepping on my foot.&rdquo;
